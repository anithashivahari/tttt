            MANTHAN AFFILIATION
            Manthan is affiliated with both CAIE (Cambridge board) and CBSE. Manthan is recognized by CAIE to offer their curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 with the recognition number IN841.

            Teaching Methodology

            Manthan is a new age institution that focuses on a skills-based, student-centered, inquiry-oriented, personalized model of learning as opposed to the traditional content-based, teacher-centered, examination-oriented one-size-fits-all model of teaching.

            Manthan’s core objective is to see that, at the end of the schooling years, a student is performing to the best of his/her academic ability, is groomed as a well-rounded personality who can excel at any chosen career, and has imbibed the right human values and has his/her heart in the right place.</p>

    <h1>At Manthan, parents are partners in the education of their children. Only when both the school and parents work in tandem can learning goals be achieved.

We keep parents well informed through a variety of means such as through the online school management software, SMS alerts, emails and letters. Time is allocated for regular interaction with teachers and with the school leadership team.

ONLINE SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

Parents are given access to the software through secure login passwords whereby they can see the progress of their children. Every Friday, teachers post the lesson plans for the next week by subject and by class. This is accessible to parents. The software also gives parents information on their child's attendance, library books, fee payment particulars, medical records related to medical checkups and any emergencies, school calendar, updated timetables, special announcements, access to photo galleries of their children's class and school among others. All the teachers and staff members regularly access their emails. </h1>
